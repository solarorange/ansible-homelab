# CodeRabbit Quick Start Guide

## What is CodeRabbit?
CodeRabbit is an AI-powered code review tool that automatically analyzes your code for issues, suggests improvements, and helps maintain code quality. It's particularly useful for iterative code review processes.

## Setup

### 1. GitHub Integration
CodeRabbit is already configured in this project with:
- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/coderabbit.yml`
- **Configuration**: `.coderabbit.yaml`
- **Focus**: Functionality, reliability, and production readiness

### 2. Required Secrets
Ensure these secrets are set in your GitHub repository:
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` (automatically provided)
- `CODERABBIT_AI_API_KEY` (you need to add this)

### 3. Getting Your CodeRabbit API Key
1. Visit [CodeRabbit.ai](https://coderabbit.ai)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Generate an API key
4. Add it to your repository secrets as `CODERABBIT_AI_API_KEY`

## Usage

### Automatic Reviews
CodeRabbit automatically runs when:
- A pull request is created
- A pull request is updated
- Code is pushed to main/develop branches

### Manual Reviews
You can trigger CodeRabbit manually by:
1. Going to your repository
2. Clicking on "Actions"
3. Selecting "CodeRabbit Review"
4. Clicking "Run workflow"

### Review Focus Areas
Based on our configuration, CodeRabbit will focus on:

#### Critical Issues
- Security vulnerabilities
- Hardcoded secrets
- Privilege escalation problems
- SSL/TLS misconfigurations

#### High Priority Issues
- Error handling gaps
- Resource allocation problems
- Backup procedure issues
- Monitoring configuration problems

#### Core Functionality
- Ansible playbook syntax
- Docker compose validation
- Variable usage and vault integration
- Security hardening configurations

## Review Process

### 1. Initial Scan
When CodeRabbit runs, it will:
- Analyze your entire codebase
- Identify issues by priority
- Provide actionable feedback
- Suggest specific improvements

### 2. Issue Triage
Review the issues in order of priority:
1. **Critical**: Fix immediately
2. **High**: Fix soon
3. **Medium**: Fix when possible
4. **Low**: Optional improvements

### 3. Iterative Fixes
Address issues one at a time:
- Fix the highest priority issue
- Test the fix
- Commit and push
- Let CodeRabbit review again
- Repeat until all critical issues are resolved

### 4. Validation
After each fix:
- Run local tests if possible
- Check that the fix doesn't introduce new problems
- Ensure services remain functional
- Update documentation as needed

## Configuration Details

### File Patterns
CodeRabbit will review:
- `**/*.yml` - Ansible playbooks and roles
- `**/*.py` - Python scripts
- `**/*.sh` - Shell scripts
- `**/docker-compose*.yml` - Docker configurations
- `**/templates/**/*.j2` - Jinja2 templates

### Excluded Files
CodeRabbit will ignore:
- Log files
- Backup files
- Temporary files
- Documentation-only changes

### Review Style
- **Constructive**: Focuses on improvements, not criticism
- **Actionable**: Provides specific suggestions
- **Examples**: Includes code examples when helpful
- **Documentation**: Links to relevant resources

## Best Practices

### 1. Address Issues Incrementally
- Don't try to fix everything at once
- Focus on one issue type at a time
- Test each fix before moving to the next

### 2. Maintain Functionality
- Ensure services remain running
- Don't break existing functionality
- Test changes in isolation when possible

### 3. Document Changes
- Update relevant documentation
- Note any configuration changes
- Document new procedures or requirements

### 4. Validate Security
- Ensure no secrets are exposed
- Validate SSL/TLS configurations
- Check privilege escalation patterns

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### CodeRabbit Not Running
- Check that the workflow file exists
- Verify secrets are properly configured
- Check GitHub Actions permissions

#### False Positives
- Some suggestions may not apply to your use case
- Use your judgment to determine relevance
- Focus on critical and high-priority issues

#### Performance Issues
- Large codebases may take longer to analyze
- Consider breaking large reviews into smaller chunks
- Use the file exclusion patterns if needed

### Getting Help
- Check the [CodeRabbit documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai)
- Review the workflow logs in GitHub Actions
- Consult the project's review checklist

## Next Steps

1. **Set up your CodeRabbit API key**
2. **Create a test pull request** to trigger the first review
3. **Review the initial feedback** and prioritize issues
4. **Start with Phase 1** of the review checklist
5. **Iterate through fixes** one at a time
6. **Validate functionality** after each fix

## Success Metrics

You'll know the review process is working when:
- Critical security issues are resolved
- All playbooks execute without errors
- Services deploy and run successfully
- SSL certificates are properly configured
- Monitoring and backup procedures work correctly

Remember: The goal is functionality and reliability, not perfection. Focus on what makes your homelab work reliably in production.
