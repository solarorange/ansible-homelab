- **Purpose**: Automatically triggers CodeRabbit reviews on PR creation and updates
- **Triggers**: Pull requests and pushes to main/develop branches

### 2. CodeRabbit Configuration
- **File**: `.coderabbit.yaml`
- **Focus**: Functionality, reliability, and production readiness
- **Priority**: Critical and high-priority issues
- **Scope**: Core infrastructure, security, and automation

### 3. Review Documentation
- **Review Checklist**: `CODERABBIT_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`
  - 5-phase review process
  - Priority-based issue categorization
  - Success criteria and validation steps
- **Quick Start Guide**: `CODERABBIT_QUICK_START.md`
  - Setup instructions
  - Usage guidelines
  - Best practices and troubleshooting

### 4. Starter Script
- **File**: `scripts/start_coderabbit_review.sh`
- **Purpose**: Validates setup and guides you through the review process
- **Usage**: Run `./scripts/start_coderabbit_review.sh` to begin

## Configuration Details

### CodeRabbit Focus Areas
- **Security**: Secret detection, privilege escalation, SSL/TLS validation
- **Reliability**: Error handling, resource optimization, backup procedures
- **Functionality**: Ansible syntax, Docker validation, variable usage
- **Production Readiness**: Monitoring, logging, health checks

### File Patterns
**Included for Review:**
- `**/*.yml` - Ansible playbooks and roles
- `**/*.py` - Python scripts
- `**/*.sh` - Shell scripts
- `**/docker-compose*.yml` - Docker configurations
- `**/templates/**/*.j2` - Jinja2 templates

**Excluded from Review:**
- Log files, backup files, temporary files
- Documentation-only changes
- Test files and build artifacts

### Review Priorities
1. **Critical**: Security vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets
2. **High**: Error handling, resource issues, backup problems
3. **Medium**: Code style, documentation, performance
4. **Low**: Cosmetic changes, minor optimizations

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Set Up CodeRabbit API Key
1. Visit [CodeRabbit.ai](https://coderabbit.ai)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Generate an API key
4. Add to GitHub repository secrets as `CODERABBIT_AI_API_KEY`

### 2. Start the Review Process
1. Run the starter script: `./scripts/start_coderabbit_review.sh`
2. Create a test pull request
3. Let CodeRabbit analyze your code
4. Review and prioritize the feedback

### 3. Iterative Fixes
1. Start with Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure)
2. Fix critical issues first
3. Test each fix
4. Commit and push to trigger another review
5. Continue through all phases

## Integration with Existing CI

### Current CI Workflow
- **File**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- **Purpose**: Ansible syntax checking, linting, Docker validation
- **Status**: Cleaned up and consolidated

### CodeRabbit Workflow
- **File**: `.github/workflows/coderabbit.yml`
- **Purpose**: AI-powered code review and suggestions
- **Status**: Newly added and configured

### Workflow Coordination
- CI runs first for basic validation
- CodeRabbit runs for comprehensive review
- Both workflows complement each other
- No conflicts between the two systems

## Expected Benefits

### 1. Automated Code Review
- Consistent review standards
- 24/7 availability
- No human reviewer fatigue

### 2. Focus on Functionality
- Prioritizes critical issues
- Suggests specific improvements
- Maintains production readiness

### 3. Iterative Improvement
- Continuous feedback loop
- Incremental fixes
- Systematic approach to code quality

### 4. Security Enhancement
- Automated secret detection
- Security best practices
- Compliance validation

## Success Metrics

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
- [ ] CodeRabbit successfully analyzes the codebase
- [ ] Critical security issues are identified
- [ ] First round of fixes is implemented

### Medium Term (1-2 months)
- [ ] All critical issues are resolved
- [ ] High-priority issues are addressed
- [ ] Code quality metrics improve

### Long Term (3+ months)
- [ ] All major issues are resolved
- [ ] Codebase is production-ready
- [ ] Automated review process is established

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Set up your CodeRabbit API key
2. **This Week**: Run the starter script and create a test PR
3. **Next Week**: Begin Phase 1 of the review process
4. **Ongoing**: Iterate through fixes and improvements

## Support and Resources

- **Project Documentation**: See the review checklist and quick start guide
- **CodeRabbit Docs**: [https://docs.coderabbit.ai](https://docs.coderabbit.ai)
- **GitHub Actions**: Check workflow logs for troubleshooting
- **Project Issues**: Use GitHub issues for project-specific questions

## Notes

- **Focus**: Functionality and reliability over new features
- **Approach**: Incremental fixes, not wholesale changes
- **Goal**: Production-ready homelab deployment
- **Maintenance**: Services must remain running during updates

The setup is complete and ready to use. The iterative review process will help ensure your Ansible homelab is robust, secure, and production-ready.
