## ðŸ”§ Production Deployment Steps

### 1. Pre-Deployment Checklist
```bash
# Verify system requirements
./deploy_enhanced.sh --check-prerequisites

# Review and update configuration
nano config/config.yml
nano config/services.yml
nano config/bookmarks.yml

# Setup security
python3 scripts/security_config.py --setup
```

### 2. Security Hardening
```bash
# Generate API keys for services
python3 scripts/security_config.py --generate-key traefik
python3 scripts/security_config.py --generate-key grafana
python3 scripts/security_config.py --generate-key sonarr

# Review and update secrets
nano config/secrets.yml

# Verify file permissions
ls -la config/
```

### 3. Production Deployment
```bash
# Run deployment
./deploy_enhanced.sh

# Verify deployment
./deploy_enhanced.sh --status

# Test all functionality
curl -s http://localhost:3000
sudo systemctl status homepage-health-monitor
```

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification
```bash
# Check logs
sudo journalctl -u homepage-health-monitor -f
docker-compose logs homepage

# Verify health monitoring
curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Test backup system
python3 scripts/backup_manager.py --create
python3 scripts/backup_manager.py --list
```

## ðŸš¨ Critical Security Considerations

### API Key Security
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use least privilege principle for API access

### Network Security
- Use HTTPS for all external access
- Implement proper firewall rules
- Use VPN for remote access
- Monitor network traffic for anomalies

### Container Security
