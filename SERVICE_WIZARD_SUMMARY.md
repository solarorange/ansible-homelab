# 🚀 Ansible Homelab Service Integration Wizard - Complete!

## What Was Built

I've successfully created a comprehensive **Service Integration Wizard** that automates the process of adding new services to your Ansible homelab stack. This wizard follows your exact prompt requirements and integrates seamlessly with your existing infrastructure.

## 🎯 Core Features

### ✅ **Complete Role Generation**
- Creates full role structure with all required directories and files
- Generates production-ready Docker Compose templates with Traefik integration
- Creates comprehensive variable files following your established patterns
- Generates all task files (deploy, monitoring, security, backup, homepage, alerts, validation)

### ✅ **Full Stack Integration**
- **Traefik Integration**: Automatic SSL/TLS, routing, and middleware
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics, Grafana dashboards, health checks
- **Security**: Hardening, access controls, fail2ban integration
- **Backup**: Automated backup scripts with retention policies
- **Homepage**: Service registration and status monitoring
- **Alerting**: Prometheus alert rules and notification integration

### ✅ **Smart Analysis & Validation**
- Analyzes repository URLs to extract configuration details
- Detects port conflicts with existing services
- Validates generated files and configurations
- Provides comprehensive error checking and warnings

### ✅ **Consistent Patterns**
- Follows your established role structure and naming conventions
- Uses the same variable patterns as existing roles
- Integrates with your staged deployment approach
- Maintains consistency with your monitoring and security infrastructure

## 📁 Generated Structure

For each service, the wizard creates:

```
roles/{service_name}/
├── README.md                 # Comprehensive documentation
├── defaults/
│   └── main.yml             # All configurable variables (100+ lines)
├── tasks/
│   ├── main.yml             # Main orchestration
│   ├── deploy.yml           # Deployment tasks
│   ├── monitoring.yml       # Monitoring integration
│   ├── security.yml         # Security hardening
│   ├── backup.yml           # Backup configuration
│   ├── homepage.yml         # Homepage integration
│   ├── alerts.yml           # Alerting rules
│   ├── validate.yml         # Pre-deployment validation
│   └── validate_deployment.yml # Post-deployment validation
├── templates/
│   ├── docker-compose.yml.j2 # Docker Compose with Traefik
│   ├── monitoring.yml.j2     # Prometheus configuration

│   └── alerts.yml.j2         # Alert rules
└── handlers/
    └── main.yml             # Service handlers
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### Interactive Mode (Recommended)
```bash
# From your ansible_homelab project root
./scripts/add_service.sh
```

### Non-Interactive Mode
```bash
python3 scripts/service_wizard.py --service-name "myapp" --repository-url "https://github.com/user/myapp"
```

### Example Workflow
```bash
# 1. Run the wizard
./scripts/add_service.sh

# 2. Provide service information:
# Service Name: myapp
# Repository URL: https://github.com/user/myapp
# Display Name: My Awesome App
# Category: utilities
# Stage: stage3

# 3. Wizard generates complete role structure

# 4. Deploy the service
ansible-playbook site.yml --tags myapp

# 5. Access at: https://myapp.yourdomain.com
```
