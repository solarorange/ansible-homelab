# Executive Summary: Ansible Homelab Infrastructure

## What is This Project?

This is a comprehensive home server infrastructure project that transforms a single computer or multiple computers into a powerful, automated home network. Think of it as creating your own private cloud - like having your own version of Google Drive, Netflix, and smart home system, all running on equipment you own and control.

## The Problem This Solves

Most people rely on external services for:
- **File Storage**: Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud
- **Media Streaming**: Netflix, Spotify, YouTube
- **Home Automation**: Smart home devices controlled by external companies
- **Security**: Relying on external security services
- **Privacy**: Data stored on servers you don't control

This project brings all these capabilities into your home, giving you:
- **Complete Control**: Your data stays on your equipment
- **Privacy**: No external companies monitoring your usage
- **Cost Savings**: One-time investment instead of monthly subscriptions
- **Customization**: Tailor everything to your specific needs
- **Reliability**: No dependency on external internet services

3. **Reverse Proxy**: A smart traffic director that routes requests to the right services
4. **Monitoring Stack**: Comprehensive monitoring and alerting system
5. **Backup System**: Automated backup and disaster recovery

### Infrastructure Requirements
- **Hardware**: Any modern computer (can be repurposed from old equipment)
- **Storage**: 1-4TB of storage space (depending on media collection)
- **Network**: Standard home internet connection
- **Power**: Similar to running a gaming computer

### Deployment Options
- **Single Server**: Everything on one computer (simplest)
- **Multi-Server**: Distributed across multiple computers (more powerful)
- **Cloud Integration**: Hybrid approach with some services in the cloud
