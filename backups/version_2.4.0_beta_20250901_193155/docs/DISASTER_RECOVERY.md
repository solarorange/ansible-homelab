## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive disaster recovery procedures for the Ansible homelab infrastructure. It covers backup strategies, recovery procedures, business continuity planning, and testing methodologies to ensure rapid recovery from various disaster scenarios.

## Disaster Recovery Planning

### Risk Assessment

```yaml
# disaster_recovery/risk_assessment.yml
risk_assessment:
  high_risk_scenarios:
    - name: "Hardware Failure"
      probability: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: "Redundant hardware, hot spares"
    
    - name: "Data Corruption"
      probability: low
      impact: critical
      mitigation: "Regular backups, integrity checks"
    
    - name: "Natural Disaster"
      probability: low
