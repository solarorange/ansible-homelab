```

### 5. Management Scripts

#### Blackbox Exporter
```bash
./manage.sh test <url>      # Test service
./manage.sh cert <url>      # Check SSL certificate
./manage.sh dns <domain>    # Test DNS resolution
./manage.sh ping <ip>       # Test network connectivity
```

#### Alertmanager
```bash
./manage.sh alerts          # View current alerts
./manage.sh silences        # View silences
./manage.sh test            # Test notifications
./manage.sh reload          # Reload configuration
```
