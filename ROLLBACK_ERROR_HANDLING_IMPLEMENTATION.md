# Rollback Error Handling Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of comprehensive error handling for the rollback system in the main.yml playbook. The changes ensure that when tasks fail, detailed error context is captured and passed to the rollback handler for better debugging and audit trails.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Rollback Handler (main.yml lines 279-320)
- **Added failure context capture**: Before executing rollback tasks, the handler now captures detailed information about the failed task
- **Enhanced variable passing**: The rollback tasks now receive comprehensive error context including:
  - `rollback_error`: Structured error object with task details
  - `rollback_cause`: Human-readable failure description
  - `rollback_timestamp`: When the failure occurred
  - `rollback_reason`: General rollback reason

### 2. Error Context Structure
The captured error context includes:
```yaml
rollback_error:
  task_name: "Name of the failed task"
  error_message: "Error message (with sensitive data redacted)"
  module: "Ansible module that failed"
  host: "Host where failure occurred"
  timestamp: "ISO8601 timestamp of failure"
  failed_stage: "Tags/stage where failure occurred"
```

### 3. Security Features
- **Sensitive data redaction**: Passwords, tokens, and secrets are automatically redacted using regex patterns
- **Message truncation**: Error messages are limited to 200 characters to prevent log flooding
- **Safe error handling**: All error context variables have fallback defaults

### 4. Enhanced Rollback Tasks (tasks/rollback.yml)
- **Detailed logging**: Rollback initiation and completion are logged with full context
- **Structured logging**: Error details are written to `/var/log/ansible-rollbacks.log`
- **Enhanced reporting**: Final rollback status includes original failure context

### 5. Comprehensive Error Handling Coverage
Added `notify: rollback_deployment` to all critical tasks:
- **Pre-deployment validation**: Variable validation, Cloudflare config, port validation
- **Core deployment stages**: Infrastructure, applications, dashboards
- **Post-deployment validation**: Health checks, SSL validation
- **Setup and backup tasks**: Prerequisites and safety measures

### 6. Enhanced Notifications
- **Webhook notifications**: Include detailed failure context in rollback notifications
- **Audit trail**: All rollback actions are logged with timestamps and context
- **Debug output**: Comprehensive error information displayed during rollback

## Files Modified

### main.yml
- Enhanced rollback handler with error context capture
- Added error handling to all critical deployment stages
- Enhanced notification payload with failure details

### tasks/rollback.yml
- Added error context logging and display
- Enhanced rollback status reporting
- Added completion logging with failure context

### test_rollback_error_handling.yml (New)
- Test playbook to verify error handling functionality
- Simulates task failures to test rollback context capture

## Usage

### Automatic Error Handling
The system automatically captures error context when any task with `notify: rollback_deployment` fails. No manual intervention required.

### Manual Testing
Use the test playbook to verify error handling:
```bash
ansible-playbook test_rollback_error_handling.yml
```

### Monitoring
- Check `/var/log/ansible-rollbacks.log` for rollback history
- Monitor webhook notifications for detailed failure reports
- Review Ansible output for comprehensive error context

## Benefits

1. **Better Debugging**: Detailed error context helps identify root causes
2. **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all rollback actions and failures
3. **Security**: Automatic redaction of sensitive information
4. **Operational Excellence**: Comprehensive error handling across all deployment stages
5. **Maintenance**: Easier troubleshooting and issue resolution

## Security Considerations

- All sensitive fields (password, token, secret) are automatically redacted
- Error messages are truncated to prevent log flooding
- No credentials or secrets are exposed in rollback logs
- Error context is sanitized before being passed to external systems

## Future Enhancements

- Add error categorization (critical, warning, info)
- Implement error pattern recognition for common failures
- Add automated recovery suggestions based on error context
- Enhance notification channels (email, Slack, etc.)
