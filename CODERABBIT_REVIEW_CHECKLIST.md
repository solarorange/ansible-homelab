# CodeRabbit Iterative Review Checklist

## Overview
This document outlines the iterative review process using CodeRabbit to ensure the Ansible homelab codebase is functional, reliable, and production-ready.

## Review Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Review
- [ ] **Main Playbook (`main.yml`)**
  - [ ] Syntax validation
  - [ ] Variable usage and vault integration
  - [ ] Privilege escalation patterns
  - [ ] Error handling and rollback procedures
  - [ ] Security validation checks

- [ ] **Site Configuration (`site.yml`)**
  - [ ] Service inclusion logic
  - [ ] Dependency management
  - [ ] Conditional execution patterns

- [ ] **Inventory and Variables**
  - [ ] `inventory.yml` structure
  - [ ] `group_vars/all/` variable definitions
  - [ ] Vault integration validation
  - [ ] Environment-specific configurations

### Phase 2: Role and Task Review
- [ ] **Critical Roles**
  - [ ] `roles/automation/` - Core automation framework
  - [ ] `roles/security/` - Security hardening
  - [ ] `roles/certificate_management/` - SSL/TLS setup
  - [ ] `roles/databases/` - Database configurations
  - [ ] `roles/monitoring/` - Monitoring stack

- [ ] **Task Files**
  - [ ] `tasks/` directory structure
  - [ ] Task dependencies and ordering
  - [ ] Error handling patterns
  - [ ] Idempotency validation

### Phase 3: Template and Configuration Review
- [ ] **Docker Compose Templates**
  - [ ] `templates/` directory validation
  - [ ] Environment variable usage
  - [ ] Port conflict resolution
  - [ ] Resource allocation patterns

- [ ] **Configuration Files**
  - [ ] Nginx configurations
  - [ ] Security policies
  - [ ] Monitoring configurations
  - [ ] Backup and recovery scripts

### Phase 4: Security and Compliance Review
- [ ] **Security Hardening**
  - [ ] Firewall configurations
  - [ ] SSL/TLS setup
  - [ ] Access control patterns
  - [ ] Secret management

- [ ] **Compliance Checks**
  - [ ] No hardcoded passwords
  - [ ] Proper vault usage
  - [ ] Audit trail implementation
  - [ ] Backup procedures

### Phase 5: Automation and Reliability Review
- [ ] **Automation Scripts**
  - [ ] `scripts/` directory validation
  - [ ] Error handling and logging
  - [ ] Rollback procedures
  - [ ] Health check implementations

- [ ] **CI/CD Pipeline**
  - [ ] GitHub Actions workflows
  - [ ] Testing procedures
  - [ ] Deployment validation
  - [ ] Rollback mechanisms

## Review Priorities

### Critical (Fix Immediately)
1. **Security vulnerabilities**
2. **Hardcoded secrets or credentials**
3. **Privilege escalation issues**
4. **SSL/TLS configuration problems**
5. **Firewall misconfigurations**

### High (Fix Soon)
1. **Error handling gaps**
2. **Resource allocation issues**
3. **Backup procedure problems**
4. **Monitoring configuration issues**
5. **Dependency conflicts**

### Medium (Fix When Possible)
1. **Code style inconsistencies**
2. **Documentation gaps**
3. **Performance optimizations**
4. **Logging improvements**

### Low (Optional)
1. **Cosmetic formatting**
2. **Documentation typos**
3. **Minor performance tweaks**

## CodeRabbit Integration

### Configuration
- **File**: `.coderabbit.yaml`
- **Focus**: Functionality and reliability over new features
- **Priority**: Critical and high priority issues
- **Scope**: Core infrastructure and security

### Workflow
1. **Automatic Review**: Triggers on PR creation and updates
2. **Manual Review**: Can be triggered manually for specific files
3. **Iterative Feedback**: Address issues in order of priority
4. **Validation**: Ensure fixes don't introduce new problems

### Review Process
1. **Initial Scan**: CodeRabbit analyzes the entire codebase
2. **Issue Prioritization**: Focus on critical and high-priority issues
3. **Iterative Fixes**: Address issues one at a time
4. **Validation**: Run tests after each fix
5. **Documentation**: Update documentation as needed

## Success Criteria

### Functionality
- [ ] All playbooks execute without errors
- [ ] Services deploy and start successfully
- [ ] SSL certificates are properly configured
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting work correctly
- [ ] Backup and recovery procedures function

### Reliability
- [ ] Idempotent execution of all tasks
- [ ] Proper error handling and rollback
- [ ] Resource usage optimization
- [ ] Comprehensive logging
- [ ] Health check implementations

### Security
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Proper privilege escalation
- [ ] SSL/TLS configuration
- [ ] Firewall rules
- [ ] Access control

### Production Readiness
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Automated testing
- [ ] Deployment procedures
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Backup and recovery

## Next Steps

1. **Initial Review**: Run CodeRabbit on the entire codebase
2. **Issue Triage**: Prioritize issues by severity and impact
3. **Iterative Fixes**: Address issues one phase at a time
4. **Validation**: Test fixes in isolation
5. **Integration**: Ensure fixes work together
6. **Documentation**: Update all relevant documentation

## Notes

- Focus on functionality over new features
- Ensure all services remain running during updates
- Maintain Cloudflare integration and SSL configuration
- Validate vault integration for all secrets
- Test interoperability between services
